## Who I am?
<p class="paragraph">
	I am a French IT engineer student at CESI Lille in France. I am currently in my fourth year of IT Engineering out of five.
	I spent most of my personnal time developing video games with the game engine Unity, however, my first projects was created using Game Maker Studio 2 band RPG Maker VX Ace, but these engines were too restrictive for us. 
</p>

<p class="paragraph">
	Hopefully, I do not work alone, I created in 2017 with Antonin Jacob (do not hesitate to check its work too <a href = "https://sheepybullet.itch.io/">sheepybullet.itch.io</a>) a video game development club called Wild Box Studio.
	Most of my works and prototypes are related to this club, even if I make some prototypes (and write some novels and role playing games) alone.
</p>

<p class="paragraph">
	I am making these projects as a hobbyist because game development is not a part of my IT engineering courses.

## Wild Box Studio
<p class="paragraph">
	Wild Box Studio is a video game development club I created with <a href ="https://www.linkedin.com/in/antonin-jacob-lille/">Antonin Jacob</a> in 2017. 
	We try making and developing games with our basic knowledge of the video game industry. 
	By combining our experiences, skills and our IT Engineering courses we are able to create small playable prototypes as hobbyists.

	<br>

	I am in charge of development (towers, enemies, UI and more), design and additional graphics if needed.

### Space Destructor
<img src="Space Destructor.png" alt="hi" class="figure"/>

<p class="centered">
	My first completed project on Unity was a bullet hell with endless waves of enemies. It was done under two months in July 2019 and helped me to understand Unity.
	
	<br>

	I was working alone on this project, but, one of the member of Wild Box helped me with the music theme.

### Earth's Disaster
<img src="Earth's Disaster.png" alt="hi" class="figure"/>

<p class="centered">
	My second project was a metroidvania in a sci-fi scene. After more than a year and a half of development with one of my colleague we stop this project for a more adaptative engine: Unity.

	<br>

	During this project I was mainly doing level design, story writing and developing.
	
	<br>

	The project was not polished enough to be published on Itch.io
