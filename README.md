## Who I am?
I am a French IT engineer student at CESI Lille in France. I am currently in my fourth year of IT Engineering out of five.  
I spent most of my personnal time developing video games with the game engine Unity (I was using Game Maker Sutdio 2 before). I do not work alone, I created in 2017 with Antonin Jacob (check its works! <https://sheepybullet.itch.io/>) a video game development club called Wild Box Studio.  
Most of my works and prototypes are related to Wild Box Studio, even if I make some prototypes (and write some novels) alone.  
My proudest (and cleaner) works are available on my itch.io profile: <https://gabriel-jouet.itch.io/>  


## Wild Box Studio
Wild Box Studio is a video game development club I create with Antonin Jacob in 2017. We try to make game design, game art and game development more accessible to everybody and share our (basic) knowledge of the video game industry.  
By combining our experiences and our IT Engineering courses we are able to create prototypes, even if none of us is an artist.  
You can find some of our club members on itch.io:  
* Antonin (Sheepy Bullet): <https://sheepybullet.itch.io/>
* Valentin (sydiko): <https://sydiko.itch.io/>
* François (Ectomorphe): <https://ectomorphe.itch.io/>


## My Experiences
Like I have said before, I am an IT Engineering student at CESI in Lille currently in my fourht year out of five.  
Our school wants us to make multiple internships, so did I.  

My most recent experience started in September 2020 to January 2021, I have a position of Gameplay Programmer at 1492 Studio (part of Ubisoft Paris Mobile) in Montreuil, France during 22 weeks.  
I mainly worked with PHP for their API and their server-side authentification. At the middle of my internship I was prompted to rework and improve their tracking system with Unity inside the new studio game: Is It Love? Stories.  

From January 2020 to April 2020 I have a position of Game Developer at YS Interactive in Valenciennes, France during 14 weeks.  
I developed several mini-games with Unity in order to test cognitive skills (a hidden object game with graduating difficulty for example). With these skills I designed a new UI system that displayed cognitive skills for the player.

From April 2019 to June 2019 I have a position of Web Developer at AREP FRESC in Roubaix, France during 12 weeks.  
During this internship, I have to develop and create a new tool for the company with one of my colleague. We develop a web-based tool with Symfony 4 and managed presentations and resources management.  

From September 2018 to November 2018 I have a position of Symfony Developer at Cube Solution in Seclin, France during 8 weeks.  
This was my first internship, with one of my colleagues (Antonin Jacob, the one that founded with me Wild Box Studio) we worked on a new tool for Nord Avenir Technologies with Symfony 4.


## My Works
Although I work mainly on Unity for three years now, I tried other engines at my beginning like RPG Maker and Game Maker Studio 2.  
RPG Maker was too restrictive for me and my only work with it was a JRPG with few leves without any combat or anythng really interesting. I was mainly doing arts and design (level design and enemy sketches with François (Ectomorphe).

My second project was a metroidvania in a sci-fi scene. After more than a year and a half of development with my friend Antonin (Sheepy Bullet) we stop this project for a more adaptative and less-limited engine: Unity.  
During this project I was mainly doing level design, story writing and developing.  
This project took us a very long time because we were focused on our IT Engineering school at the same time and we were both learning alone. Sheepy Bullet was learning how to make pixel art and animation and I was learning how to use object-oriented programmation.

My first real project on Unity was a bullet hell with endless waves of enemies. (Several other projects were developed but are either not very interesting or too ugly to watch)  
This project was done under three weeks, although several versions were (re) done in order to improve QoL.  
I was working alone on this project, but, one of the member of Wild Box helped me with the music theme.

My second project on Unity was a Roguelite created for a game jam. This game jam took place from Mars 2020 to Avril 2020, the goal was to develop a roguelite under a month.  
I was in charge of game design, level design and development. Valentin (sydiko) was sketching and drawing level tilesets and traps whereas another friend was helping developing with me.

My biggest project ever made is a Tower Defense where you play as plants that needs to defend themselves against insects. This is my biggest project by far, the project begin in May 2020 and is still going.  
I am charged of development, design and additional graphics if needed (I made every insect for example). My friend sydiko is level designing and drawing every other arts.
