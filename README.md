## Who I am?
I am an IT engineer student at CESI Lille in France. I am currently in my fourth year out of five.  
I spent most of my personnal time developing video games with the game engine Unity. I do not work alone, I created in 2017 with my one of my colleague a video game development club called Wild Box Studio.  
Most of my works and prototypes are related to Wild Box Studio, even if I make some prototypes (and write some novels) alone.  
My proudest works are available on my itch.io profile: <https://gabriel-jouet.itch.io/>
