## Who am I?
<p class="paragraph">
	I am a French IT engineer student at CESI Lille in France. I am currently in my fifth year of IT Engineering out of five.
	I spent most of my personnal time developing video games with the game engine <strong>Unity</strong>. However, my first projects were created using <strong>Game Maker Studio 2</strong> and <strong>RPG Maker VX Ace</strong>. But these engines were too restrictive for us. 
</p>

<p class="paragraph">
	Hopefully, I do not work alone. I created in 2017 with <a href ="https://www.linkedin.com/in/antonin-jacob-lille/">Antonin Jacob</a> (do not hesitate to check its work too <a href = "https://sheepybullet.itch.io/">sheepybullet.itch.io</a>) a video game development club called Wild Box Studio.
	Most of my works and prototypes are related to this club, even if I make some prototypes (and write some novels and role playing games) alone.
</p>

<p class="paragraph">
	I am making these projects as a hobbyist because game development is not a part of my IT engineering courses.

## Wild Box Studio
<p class="paragraph">
	Wild Box Studio is a video game development club I created with <a href ="https://www.linkedin.com/in/antonin-jacob-lille/">Antonin Jacob</a> in 2017. 
	We try making and developing games with our basic knowledge of the video game industry. 
	By combining our experiences, skills and our IT Engineering courses, we are able to create small playable prototypes as hobbyists.

### Earth's Disaster
<img src="Earth's Disaster.png" alt="hi" class="figure"/>

<p class="centered">
	My first real project was a <strong>Metroidvania in a sci-fi scene</strong>. 

	<br>
	
	After a year and a half of development, with one of my colleague, we stop this project for a more adaptative engine: Unity.

	<br>

	During this project, I was mainly doing level design, story writing and developing.
</p>

<p class="centered">
	The project was not polished enough to be published on Itch.io
